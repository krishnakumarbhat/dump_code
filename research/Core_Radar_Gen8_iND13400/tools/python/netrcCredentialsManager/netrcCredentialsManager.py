Package used to create a .netrc file as well as check if the credentials are valid for a given URL.

A JSON file is required to specify the credential requirements. This can either be stored alongside this script,
which is used by default, or a path can be provided to another location.

The JSON shold have the following format:
{
    "hosts": [{
        "name": ".netrc name here ie. gitgerrit.asux.aptiv.com",
        "authCheckUrl": "URL to request to which the user must have access"

        "name": ".netrc name 2 here",
        "authCheckUrl": "URL to request to which the user must have access"
    }],
